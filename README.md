# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to help Dana with her website so users can have access to UFO data. We used Javascript to create a website where users can interact with certain filters such as date, city, state, country, and shape. This will allow users to be more selective and gain greater insight.

## Results
From the script I have created, users will be able to see the website. They can view the link by clicking [here](https://github.com/jasonhmlee/UFOs/blob/main/index.html). On the left hand side there are 5 filters. The user can input their selected filter from date, city, stae, country, and shape. For example, if a user wants to filter out the data based on the state California, under the State filter, they will type ca and hit enter. Then the website will show only results based on California. To go back, they will just hit delete and the original page will be uploaded.

## Summary

There were a few drawbacks of this design and can have room for improvement

- If there were more images on the interface, it could draw the users attention a bit better
- Allow users to find specific words on the page. This will help users find exactly what they want.
